    SWPBL-153417
    The invalidateCache command will be used to invalidate the local player's
    cache of various services(mhs, auth, entitlements). To do this, the command generates and updates a replicated file
    with the time of when the cache is good until.

    This test is to verify the mechanism of the file management. The file should be created if it doesn't exist and the
    correct entry in it should be updated after each invalidate call is made. The file should then be replicated across
    the household.

    Note:
    The player uses the UUID in the value field for invalidation logic.
    That value has to change in order for the caches to be invalidated.

    Example httpcaches.json:
    {u'entries': [{u'expires': u'1970-01-01T00:47:10.000Z',
    u'key': u'authzTokens',
